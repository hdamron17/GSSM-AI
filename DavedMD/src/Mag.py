''' 
DavedMD chatbot logic engine parses inputs and responds accordingly
* Stores information about responses to questions about symptoms
* Must have response something if user responds that they've never had any disease
* If the bot gets exhausted of responses, it will "refer you to another professional" aka restart the bot (possibly with a different name)
